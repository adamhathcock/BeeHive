1,A,Under the hood, more_like_this simply creates multiple should 
2,A,clauses in a bool query of interesting terms extracted from some provided text. 
3,B,The interesting terms are selected with respect to their tf-idf scores. 
4,D,These are controlled by min_term_freq, min_doc_freq, and max_doc_freq. 
5,D,The number of interesting terms is controlled by max_query_terms. 
6,D,While the minimum number of clauses that must be satisfied is 
7,D,controlled by percent_terms_to_match. The terms are extracted from like_text 
8,D,which is analyzed by the analyzer associated with the field, unless specified by analyzer. 
9,E,There are other parameters such as min_word_length
10,E,max_word_length or stop_words to control what terms should be considered as interesting. 
11,E,In order to give more weight to more interesting terms
12,F,each boolean clause associated with a term could be boosted by 
13,G,the term tf-idf 
14,H,score times some boosting factor boost_terms.
